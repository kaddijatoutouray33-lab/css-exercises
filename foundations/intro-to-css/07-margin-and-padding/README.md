# 07-margin-and-padding

This exercise focuses on understanding how to use `margin` and `padding` in CSS to control layout spacing.

## Objective

Apply spacing styles to elements so that:
- `padding` controls the space **inside** the element’s border
- `margin` controls the space **outside** the element’s border

## Instructions

You are given a layout with multiple elements. Your task is to:
- Add padding to create space between the content and the element’s border
- Add margin to create space between elements and position them cleanly
- Match the visual layout shown in the desired outcome image

## Desired Outcome

- Elements should have internal spacing around their content
- Elements should be spaced apart from each other
- Layout should be clean, readable, and visually balanced

## Self Check

- [x] Did you use `padding` to create space inside the elements?
- [x] Did you use `margin` to create space between elements?
- [x] Does the layout match the desired outcome?
